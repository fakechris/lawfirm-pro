## Integration Points

### Cross-Stream Dependencies
- Stream A depends on Stream D for database schema
- Stream B depends on Stream A for business logic
- Stream C depends on Stream D for storage configuration
- All streams require User Management System for permissions

### External Integrations
- OCR Service (Tesseract.js or cloud-based)
- Document Processing Libraries
- Cloud Storage Services
- Search Engine Integration
