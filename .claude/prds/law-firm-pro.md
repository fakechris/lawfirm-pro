# PRD: Law Firm Pro

## Executive Summary

Law Firm Pro is a comprehensive case management system designed specifically for small Chinese law firms, addressing critical challenges in efficiency, cost control, service quality, and client trust. The system implements a scientific case management framework featuring standardized 5-phase workflows, transparent stage-based billing, role-based task distribution, and integrated knowledge management. By transforming traditional "workshop-style" legal practice into standardized, efficient operations, the system enables small law firms to enhance competitiveness, improve profitability, and deliver consistent high-quality legal services.

## Problem Statement

Small Chinese law firms face significant challenges:

1. **Efficiency Bottlenecks**: Traditional workshop-style case handling leads to uncontrollable processes, with valuable attorney time consumed by low-value administrative work
2. **Cost Control Pressure**: Rising human resources, operational, and marketing costs squeeze profit margins without refined management
3. **Service Quality Inconsistency**: Over-reliance on individual attorney experience results in variable case handling quality, hindering brand development
4. **Client Trust Issues**: Lack of transparency in service processes and billing leads to client complaints and trust crises

These challenges require a fundamental management revolution rather than simple business expansion. Small law firms need an integrated solution combining process standardization, billing transparency, refined division of labor, and systematic management.
