# Stream C: Data Management & Sync

## Scope
- Data synchronization and conflict resolution
- Data transformation layer for different API formats
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Data validation and integrity checking
- Sync status monitoring and reporting

## Files
- `src/services/sync/*` - Data synchronization services
- `src/services/transformation/*` - Data transformation services
- `src/services/caching/*` - Caching services
- `src/services/validation/*` - Data validation services
- `src/models/integration/*` - Integration data models

## Progress
- Starting implementation
- Analyzing data synchronization requirements
- Setting up data transformation framework

## Implementation Tasks
1. **Data Sync Engine** - Synchronization and conflict resolution
2. **Data Transformation Layer** - Format conversion and mapping
3. **Caching Service** - Performance optimization
4. **Data Validation** - Integrity checking
5. **Sync Monitoring** - Status tracking and reporting

## Dependencies
- Database Schema âœ… Available
- External Service Integrations (Stream B) - Required
- API Gateway Framework (Stream A) - Required

## Notes
- Working in main repository (epic already merged)
- Focus on data consistency and integrity
- Implement robust conflict resolution
- Ensure high-performance data access
- Design for scalable synchronization
