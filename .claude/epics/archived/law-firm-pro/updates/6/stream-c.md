- OCR service options evaluated
- Template system architecture designed

### Working On
- File format handling utilities
- Template processing engine design

### Blocked
- Waiting for Stream D storage configuration

- OCR service integration pending

### Next Steps
1. Implement file processing utilities
2. Integrate OCR service (Tesseract.js)
3. Create template processing engine
4. Build search indexing service

### Notes
