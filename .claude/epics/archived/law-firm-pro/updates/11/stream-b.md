# Stream B: Infrastructure as Code

## Scope
- Terraform modules for cloud infrastructure
- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- Kubernetes manifests and helm charts
- Environment-specific configurations

## Files
- `terraform/*` - Terraform modules and configurations
- `kubernetes/*` - Kubernetes manifests and helm charts
- `docker/*` - Dockerfile and docker-compose files
- `infrastructure/*` - Infrastructure automation scripts
- `environments/*` - Environment-specific configurations

## Progress
✅ **COMPLETED** - All infrastructure as code components implemented successfully

### Completed Tasks:

1. **✅ Terraform Infrastructure** - Cloud provisioning and networking
   - Created comprehensive Terraform module structure
   - Implemented network module with VPC, subnets, NAT gateways
   - Built security module with security groups and access controls
   - Created compute module with ALB, SSL, and IAM roles
   - Implemented database module with RDS, Redis, and S3
   - Created Kubernetes module with EKS cluster and node groups
   - Added monitoring and logging configurations

2. **✅ Docker Containerization** - Multi-stage builds and optimization
   - Enhanced existing Dockerfile with security best practices
   - Optimized multi-stage builds for production
   - Added health checks and monitoring endpoints

3. **✅ Kubernetes Orchestration** - Container deployment and scaling
   - Created comprehensive Helm Chart structure
   - Implemented deployment, service, ingress configurations
   - Added persistent volume claims for storage
   - Configured autoscaling and resource management
   - Implemented environment-specific values files

4. **✅ Environment Management** - Dev, staging, production configs
   - Created environment-specific Terraform configurations
   - Implemented environment-specific Helm values
   - Configured appropriate resource allocations per environment
   - Set up environment-specific security settings

5. **✅ Infrastructure Automation** - Automated provisioning and updates
   - Created comprehensive deployment script (deploy.sh)
   - Implemented health check script (health-check.sh)
   - Added backup and restore functionality
   - Created infrastructure documentation

## Key Features Implemented:

### Terraform Modules
- **Network Module**: VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, VPC endpoints
- **Security Module**: Security groups, access controls, bastion host
- **Compute Module**: ALB, SSL certificates, Route 53, IAM roles
- **Database Module**: RDS PostgreSQL, ElastiCache Redis, S3 buckets
- **Kubernetes Module**: EKS cluster, node groups, OIDC provider

### Helm Chart
- **Chart Structure**: Complete Helm Chart with all necessary templates
- **Environment Configs**: Separate values files for dev/staging/prod
- **Resource Management**: Proper resource limits and requests
- **Autoscaling**: HPA configuration for production
- **Storage**: Persistent volume claims for uploads and logs

### Automation Scripts
- **Deployment Script**: Full lifecycle management (init, plan, apply, deploy, destroy, backup, restore)
- **Health Check Script**: Comprehensive health monitoring for all components
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging
- **Documentation**: Complete infrastructure documentation

### Security Best Practices
- **Network Security**: VPC isolation, private subnets, security groups
- **Data Security**: SSL encryption, S3 encryption, Redis encryption
- **Access Control**: IAM roles, least privilege, audit logs
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration, comprehensive logging

## Dependencies
- ✅ Core application architecture (from epic completion)
- ✅ Application requirements and specifications
- ✅ Cloud provider account and credentials
- ✅ CI/CD Pipeline (Stream A) - Ready for integration
- ✅ Monitoring Setup (Stream C) - Infrastructure monitoring configured
