# Task: User Management System

## Description
Implement comprehensive user management with role-based access control, granular permissions, and user profile management for legal practice teams.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) with predefined legal roles
- [ ] Granular permission system for all system features
- [ ] User profile management with skills and expertise tracking
- [ ] Team and department organization structure
- [ ] User authentication with SSO integration
- [ ] Two-factor authentication (2FA) support
- [ ] User activity logging and audit trails
- [ ] User onboarding and offboarding workflows
- [ ] Permission delegation and temporary access
- [ ] User directory with search and filtering capabilities

## Technical Details
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Build authentication service with JWT/OAuth
  - Implement RBAC system with hierarchical roles
  - Create permission management engine
  - Develop user profile service with skill tracking
  - Design audit logging system

- **Key Considerations**:
  - Legal industry compliance requirements
  - Data privacy and security regulations
  - Integration with existing HR systems
  - Performance for large user bases
  - Session management and security
  - Cross-team collaboration requirements

- **Files Affected**:
  - `/src/services/auth/` - Authentication services
  - `/src/services/users/` - User management services
  - `/src/models/users/` - User data models
  - `/src/components/auth/` - Authentication UI components
  - `/src/components/users/` - User management UI
  - `/src/api/auth/` - Authentication API endpoints
  - `/src/api/users/` - User management API endpoints
  - `/src/middleware/auth/` - Authentication middleware
  - `/src/config/auth.js` - Authentication configuration

## Dependencies
- [ ] Database schema for user management
- [ ] Authentication provider integration (SSO, 2FA)
- [ ] Email service for user notifications
- [ ] Audit logging system
- [ ] Session storage solution

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: M (Medium)
- **Hours**: 80-120 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can run in parallel with other core systems)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All user management features implemented and tested
- [ ] Unit tests with 95%+ coverage
- [ ] Integration tests with authentication providers
- [ ] Security testing and penetration testing
- [ ] Performance testing for concurrent users
- [ ] User acceptance testing with legal staff
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
