# Epic: Law Firm Pro

## Overview
Law Firm Pro is a comprehensive case management system for small Chinese law firms that implements standardized 5-phase workflows, role-based task distribution, stage-based billing, and knowledge management. The system transforms traditional legal practice into efficient, standardized operations while ensuring compliance with Chinese legal regulations and fee structures.

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for API development
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data with Redis for caching
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem with cloud backup for documents
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with orchestration support

### Key Design Patterns
- **State Machine Pattern**: For case lifecycle management and phase transitions
- **Workflow Engine Pattern**: For task generation and assignment based on case types
- **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction
- **Command Pattern**: For user actions and system events
- **Observer Pattern**: For real-time notifications and updates

### Architectural Principles
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Organize code around legal practice domains
- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular services for different business areas
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling through event messaging
- **API-First Design**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI documentation

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Dashboard**: Case overview, task assignments, and financial metrics
- **Case Management**: Case creation, phase tracking, and status management
- **Task Management**: Role-based task assignment and progress tracking
- **Financial Module**: Billing, invoicing, and expense tracking
- **Document System**: Template management, version control, and archival
- **Client Portal**: Case status visibility and communication tools
- **Admin Interface**: User management, system configuration, and reporting

### Backend Services
- **Case Service**: Case lifecycle management and state transitions
- **Task Service**: Workflow engine and task assignment logic
- **Financial Service**: Billing calculations and payment processing
- **Document Service**: Template processing and file management
- **User Service**: Authentication, authorization, and role management
- **Integration Service**: External system integrations (courts, payment)
- **Notification Service**: Email and in-app notifications

### Data Models
- **Case**: Case information, type, status, phase, and metadata
- **Task**: Task templates, assignments, dependencies, and completion
- **User**: User profiles, roles, permissions, and assignments
- **Financial**: Billing nodes, invoices, payments, and expenses
- **Document**: Templates, versions, and case-related files
- **Knowledge**: Best practices, procedures, and training materials

### Infrastructure
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker Compose for development, Kubernetes for production
- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling and backup strategies
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for session management and frequently accessed data
- **File Storage**: Secure document storage with version control and backup
- **Monitoring**: Application metrics, error tracking, and performance monitoring
- **Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit, audit logging, and compliance

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Foundation Phase (Months 1-3)**
   - Core architecture setup
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Basic case management structure
   - Database schema design

2. **Core Features Phase (Months 4-6)**
   - 5-phase case lifecycle implementation
   - Role-based task management system
   - Basic document management
   - Initial billing framework

3. **Advanced Features Phase (Months 7-9)**
   - Stage-based billing system
   - Knowledge management components
   - Client communication portal
   - Integration frameworks

4. **Optimization Phase (Months 10-12)**
   - Performance optimization
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Advanced integrations
   - Testing and deployment automation

### Risk Mitigation
- **Technical Risk**: Prototype complex components early (workflow engine, billing calculations)
- **Compliance Risk**: Engage legal experts early for workflow validation
- **Adoption Risk**: User-centered design with attorney feedback loops
- **Integration Risk**: Build abstraction layers for external system APIs

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Testing**: Jest for frontend, Jest/Supertest for backend
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end testing of critical workflows
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for concurrent user scenarios
- **Security Testing**: Penetration testing and vulnerability scanning
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Real attorney testing with production-like data
