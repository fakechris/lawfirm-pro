# Task: Document Management System

## Description
Build a comprehensive document management system with templates, version control, evidence organization, and advanced search capabilities for legal practice.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Document template system with customizable legal templates
- [ ] Version control system with change tracking and comparison
- [ ] Evidence organization with tagging, categorization, and chain of custody
- [ ] Advanced search with full-text indexing and metadata filtering
- [ ] Document workflow automation with approval processes
- [ ] Integration with Microsoft Office and Google Docs
- [ ] Document collaboration with real-time editing and commenting
- [ ] Secure document sharing with external parties
- [ ] Document retention and archiving policies
- [ ] Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for scanned documents

## Technical Details
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Build document storage service with cloud integration
  - Implement version control system with diff capabilities
  - Create evidence management with metadata extraction
  - Develop search engine with indexing capabilities
  - Design workflow automation engine

- **Key Considerations**:
  - Legal document security and confidentiality
  - File format compatibility (PDF, DOCX, images, etc.)
  - Performance for large document repositories
  - Backup and disaster recovery
  - Compliance with legal document retention requirements
  - Client data privacy regulations

- **Files Affected**:
  - `/src/services/documents/` - Document services
