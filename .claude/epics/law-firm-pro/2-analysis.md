# Issue #2 Analysis: Core Architecture

## Current Status Analysis

Issue #2 is the Core Architecture task which is critical for unblocking Case Management and Task System. Based on the task requirements and existing codebase, the following work streams can be identified:

## Work Streams

### Stream A: Database Schema Design & Implementation (Priority: CRITICAL)
**Status**: Ready to start
**Dependencies**: None
**Description**: Complete database schema design with Prisma, including migrations and all core entities
**Scope**:
- Design and implement Prisma schema for all entities (users, cases, tasks, clients, documents)
- Create database migrations
- Set up database connection pooling and configuration
- Implement data seeding for initial setup

### Stream B: REST API Structure & Endpoints (Priority: HIGH)
**Status**: Ready to start
**Dependencies**: Stream A (Database schema)
**Description**: Implement RESTful API endpoints for all core operations
**Scope**:
- Design REST API structure with Express.js
- Implement CRUD operations for all entities
- Add API rate limiting and security headers
- Create comprehensive error handling
- Generate API documentation

### Stream C: Authentication & Authorization System (Priority: HIGH)
**Status**: Ready to start
**Dependencies**: Stream A (Database schema), Stream B (API structure)
**Description**: Implement JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization
**Scope**:
- JWT token implementation with refresh rotation
- bcrypt password hashing
- User registration and login endpoints
- Role-based authorization middleware
- Authentication utilities and helpers

## Dependencies Analysis

- **Stream A** (Database) is foundational and must be completed first
- **Stream B** (API) depends on Stream A for data models
- **Stream C** (Authentication) depends on both Stream A and Stream B
- This creates a sequential dependency: A → B → C

## Recommended Execution Strategy

1. **Stream A**: Database Schema (immediate start)
2. **Stream B**: REST API (wait for Stream A completion)
3. **Stream C**: Authentication System (wait for Stream A and B completion)

## Resource Allocation

- **Stream A**: Requires database architect and Prisma expertise
- **Stream B**: Requires API developer with Express.js experience
- **Stream C**: Requires security specialist with authentication expertise

## Integration Considerations

- Must coordinate with existing completed systems (Financial Management, User Management, Client Portal)
- Database schema must support existing data models from completed tasks
- API structure must be consistent with existing endpoints
- Authentication system must integrate with existing user management

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk**: Database schema changes will impact all downstream systems
**Medium Risk**: API design inconsistencies with existing endpoints
**Medium Risk**: Authentication integration with existing user management

## Success Criteria

- Stream A: Complete database schema with migrations and seeding
- Stream B: REST API endpoints with documentation and security
- Stream C: Authentication system with JWT and role-based access control

## Coordination Notes

- Stream A must validate schema compatibility with existing completed systems
- Stream B must follow existing API patterns and conventions
- Stream C must integrate with existing User Management System
- All streams must maintain consistency with Chinese legal compliance requirements
