# Task: Document Management System

## Description
Build a comprehensive document management system with templates, version control, evidence organization, and advanced search capabilities for legal practice.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Document template system with customizable legal templates âœ…
- [x] Version control system with change tracking and comparison âœ…
- [x] Evidence organization with tagging, categorization, and chain of custody âœ…
- [x] Advanced search with full-text indexing and metadata filtering âœ…
- [x] Document workflow automation with approval processes âœ…
- [x] Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for scanned documents âœ…
- [ðŸ”„] Integration with Microsoft Office and Google Docs (Planned)
- [ðŸ”„] Document collaboration with real-time editing and commenting (In Progress)
- [ðŸ”„] Secure document sharing with external parties (Planned)
- [ðŸ”„] Document retention and archiving policies (In Progress)

## Technical Details
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Build document storage service with cloud integration
  - Implement version control system with diff capabilities
  - Create evidence management with metadata extraction
  - Develop search engine with indexing capabilities
  - Design workflow automation engine

- **Key Considerations**:
  - Legal document security and confidentiality
  - File format compatibility (PDF, DOCX, images, etc.)
  - Performance for large document repositories
  - Backup and disaster recovery
  - Compliance with legal document retention requirements
  - Client data privacy regulations

- **Files Affected**:
  - `/src/services/documents/` - Document services
  - `/src/models/documents/` - Document data models
  - `/src/components/documents/` - UI components
  - `/src/api/documents/` - API endpoints
  - `/src/utils/document-processing/` - Document processing utilities
  - `/src/config/storage.js` - Storage configuration

## Dependencies
- [ ] User Management System (for permissions and access control)
- [ ] Cloud storage service integration (AWS S3, Azure Blob, etc.)
- [ ] OCR service integration
- [ ] Database schema for document metadata
- [ ] Search engine setup (Elasticsearch or similar)

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: L (Large)
- **Hours**: 140-180 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can run in parallel with other core systems)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All document management features implemented and tested
- [ ] Unit tests with 95%+ coverage
- [ ] Integration tests with storage providers
- [ ] Performance testing for large document sets
- [ ] Security testing completed
- [ ] User acceptance testing with legal staff
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
